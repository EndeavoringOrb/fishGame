make fishies easily customizable

make fishing gameplay:
-throw out rod (click on screen, rod goes to click position)
-rod splashes and scares away fish in a certain radius (add repellor to flock)
-wait and the fish will come back (repellor has a lifetime, after which it will go away)
-eventually a fish will bite (add an attractor, if a fish is within a certain radius, they bite)
-if you press PULL in time, you will start pulling the fish in (horizontally across to the dock on the left)
-the rarer the fish, the longer it takes to pull in
-while you are pulling it in, you have to try keep it in the middle of the screen
-if the fish moves out of the center strip for too long, it will escape
